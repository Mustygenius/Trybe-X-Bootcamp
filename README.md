I will discuss on few things I learned from day one and two. Day 1 : introduction to Internet.</P>

<Strong>Internet </strong>is a place of information, entertainment, and transfer of information.it is the largest computer network connecting billions of user from different countries. I used to think Internet is just to buy data in phone and check my phone network whether they is network or not but computer is more than that,it is a network of network. As we all know, Internet connect computer all together and this can be achieved by the used of a<em> router</em>(it works like a railway station). Device that forward data among each other is called packet switches. Internet are govern by protocol,such as the 
<ul>
<li>TCP(Transmission control protocol)</li>
  <li>Http(Hyper text transfer protocol </li>
</li>DNS (Domain name system) etc. </li> 
</ul>

<ul>There are two types of network which are:
  <li>the intranet</li>
  <li>the extranet</li>
  <li>Intranet are private networks that accessed by a particular organization or are restricted to members of a particular organization</li> 
  <li>Extranet are open to all or part of a private networks to allow sharing and collaboration with company and organization </li>
  I also learned what URL means, URL means<em> Uniform resource locator</em> URL is an address of a unique resource on the Internet or it is a specific address of resource on the internet.it is used by the browser to retrieve published resources such as Css,pages and documents etc 
<ul>
  There are two types of URL Which are
  <li>absolute URL</li>
  <li>Relative URL </li>
  <li>Absolute URL contains all the necessary parts needed to locate the resources in URL</li>
    <li> Relative URL contains some part but some part are missing like Scheme or Domain or sub-resource etc </li>
</ul>
. <h4>Day2 was introduction to web technologies</h4>

<em>Web literally</em> mean to connect complex things together Computer connected to the Internet are called client and server. <strong>Client </Strong>is a typical connected device While <strony>Server </strong>are computer that store webpages,site or apps etc. <em>I also learned what it means my HTML basic From the beginning you will be seeing acronym, yeah that is how it is in computer to make writing to be short and elaborate.</em>
<em>HTML means hyper text mark up language</em> . It is a code that is used to structure a web page and it content.for example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs a list of points,or using images and data tables 
<ul>
There are different steps to consider before coding with HTML Some of the steps are 
<li>opening tag</li>
<li>closing tag</li>
<li>content </li>
<li>heading 1,or2, or 3 </li>
<li>paragraphs that is demoted with small p. etc </li>
</ul>


Content: is the text in between opening and close tag. 
Element: opening tag, closing tag, and makeup element
